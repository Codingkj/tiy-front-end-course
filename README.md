#Project Calendar

The objective of the project was to create a calendar for the month of November 2015. A user should be able to select a day, add a task to that day, and have it be stored. Days with tasks entered are to be highlighted. Then when they click on a day that has an entry in it already, that task is displayed and the user has the option to Edit or Remove that task.

Project completed in Week4 of the 12-week Front-End developer course.
Concepts used included HTML, CSS/SASS learnt to date along with Javascript and Event Handlers.
