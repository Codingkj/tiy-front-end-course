Problem 1

Research about the following HTML tags and explain their semantics:

<strong> - like bold - for saying this is important.
<em> - for providing emphasis to the text.
<blockquote> - The <blockquote> tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source.
<q> - The <q> tag defines a short quotation.
<abbr> - The <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "Mr.", "Dec.", "ASAP", "ATM".  Marking up abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
<cite> - The <cite> tag defines the title of a work (e.g. a book, a song, a movie, a TV show, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
<dfn> - The <dfn> (or definition) tag represents the defining instance of a term in HTML.
The defining instance is often the first use of a term in a document.
<address> - The <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article
<ins> - The <ins> tag defines a text that has been inserted into a document.
<del> - The <del> tag defines text that has been deleted from a document.
<s> - The <s> tag specifies text that is no longer correct, accurate or relevant.

Problem 2

Explain why do we need <thead>, <tbody> and <tfoot>?
The <tbody> element defines one or more <tr> element data-rows to be the body of a parent <table> element. This provides additional semantic information for devices such as printers and displays. For instance, <tbody> represents the content which, when longer than a page, will most likely differ for each page printed; while the content of <thead> and <tfoot> will be the same or similar for each page printed. For displays, <tbody> will enable separate scrolling of the <thead>, <tfoot>, and <caption> elements of the same parent <table> element.   Multiple <tbody> elements are permitted.
